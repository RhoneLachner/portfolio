I created this website during the winter break of my coding program in 2020/2021. I am now returning to this code in 2023 to update UX/UI, design, functionality, performance, logic, packages, file structure and to improve overall coding standards.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
